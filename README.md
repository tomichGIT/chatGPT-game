## Join us in creating an awesome platform game!
Welcome to our platform game project, where we'll be using the power of ChatGPT to develop an amazing game together. In this project, we'll be creating a platformer game from scratch, sharing ideas, code snippets, and new prompts to help us along the way.

Our goal is to create a fun and engaging game that showcases the capabilities of ChatGPT, while also providing a collaborative and educational environment for developers of all levels to learn and grow.

## How to join and contribute
To join our project, all you need is an interest in game development and a willingness to learn and collaborate with others. We welcome developers of all levels and backgrounds to join us.

Helping:
- Anyone who has a GitHub account can create a fork of the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request to have their changes merged into the main repository.
- Add ideas in projects issues section
- Contact me however you can
- You can also contribute by sharing your ideas, code snippets, and prompts in the project's issues and pull requests. 

We welcome all contributions and feedback, and look forward to working with you!
Let's create an awesome platform game together!

## What we'll be doing
Our project will involve a number of tasks, including:

- Creating game assets, such as character sprites and backgrounds
- Implementing game mechanics, such as jumping, collision detection, and enemy behavior
- Designing levels and creating level editors
- Writing and testing game code
- Creating and sharing prompts to help us generate new ideas and overcome challenges

We'll be sharing our progress and discussing new ideas in the project's issues and pull requests, so be sure to join in on the conversation and help shape the direction of the project.

## How ChatGPT will help
As a language model trained on a massive corpus of text, ChatGPT has a wide range of capabilities that can help us create our game. We can use it to generate prompts for new ideas, generate code snippets, and provide feedback on our game mechanics and design.

By working together and leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities, we can create a game that's both fun to play and showcases the power of machine learning.


## Used ChatGPT Prompts
