## How ChatGPT will help
As a language model trained on a massive corpus of text, ChatGPT has a wide range of capabilities that can help us create our game. We can use it to generate prompts for new ideas, generate code snippets, and provide feedback on our game mechanics and design.

By working together and leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities, we can create a game that's both fun to play and showcases the power of machine learning.
